# Client-Side-Work
This project contains all assignments and work for CIS 3034 - Client-Side Web Development.<br>
The assignments are divided into folders and are all linked in the index.html file. 

## Assignment Descriptions:
- **Assignment #1:** The web page prompts the user to enter their weight, then prompts them to enter their height (using prompt dialog boxes), 
calculates their BMI, and finally display the BMI on the web page (in an alert box), along with the appropriate BMI category.
- **Assignment #2:** A web page that has a form with a text box and two buttons: Add and Remove Last. 
When the Add button is clicked, whatever text the user has entered in the form should be added to a list after the form & buttons. 
When the Remove Last button is clicked, the last list item should be removed from the list. 
Use striped backgrounds for the list items, where the even ones have a light background color and the odd ones do not 
(i.e. the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc have no background whereas the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc. have the color).
- **Assignment #3:** A web page with a form and 3 drop-down boxes for the following CSS properties: color, font-size, and background color. 
You may choose what values to have in the drop-downs. When a user selects something in the list, it should change the appropriate CSS property of 
a paragraph on the page.
- **Assignment #4:** A web page that allows the user to build a sortable accordion list. The dialog box prompts the user to enter a title for an accordion (text box) 
and the content (text area). It will then use the title and content to add an item at the end of the accordion list. There are two buttons - one to add an item and one
to indicate when the user is done building the list. On the done event, the accordion widget animates. 
- **Final Project:** This project utilizes many
